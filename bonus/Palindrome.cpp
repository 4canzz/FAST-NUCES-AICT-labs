/*Write a C++ code that takes an integer input and checks if itâ€™s a palindrome.
A palindromic number (also known as a numeral palindrome or a numeric palindrome) is a number (such as 16461) 
that remains the same when its digits are reversed. In other words, it has reflectional symmetry across a vertical axis.*/
